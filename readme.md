# BASH
This is intended to be a collection of my configuration files and scripts. Hopefully, someone finds some of these useful.

## .bash_prompt
Facilitates setting PS1 dynamically according to a set of predefined rules

## .bash_colors
Facilitates switching between different color palettes for the terminal.
